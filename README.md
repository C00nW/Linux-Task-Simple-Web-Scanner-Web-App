# Linux-Task-Simple-Web-Scanner-Web-App
This project creates a simple network scanner that is accessible from a web browser within the network. Utilizing a Cron Job that triggers every 10 minutes, the system uses `nmap` to scan the network and outputs the results into a text file. A PHP script then formats these results and presents them in a web browser.
